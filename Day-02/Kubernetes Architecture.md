**Kubernetes Architecture:**

Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform, providing automation for deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. Understanding Kubernetes architecture is crucial for DevOps and Cloud engineers, as it forms the backbone of modern cloud-native infrastructure.

This guide explains **Kubernetes architecture**, including its key components, control plane, data plane, and how they interact. The article also includes comparisons with Docker to provide deeper insights.

**Introduction**

Before diving into Kubernetes architecture, let’s address a common question:

Why is Kubernetes abbreviated as **K8s**?

The word **Kubernetes** has 10 letters. The abbreviation **K8s** replaces the middle 8 letters with the number **8**:

**K + 8 letters + s = K8s**

Now, let’s understand the **difference between Docker and Kubernetes**, which is essential before exploring Kubernetes architecture.

**Docker vs. Kubernetes**

Docker is a **containerization platform**, while Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform**. Kubernetes extends Docker’s capabilities by providing:

**1.	Clustered Deployment** – Kubernetes operates across multiple nodes, unlike standalone Docker containers.

**2.	Auto-healing** – It detects failed containers and replaces them automatically.

**3.	Auto-scaling** – Kubernetes scales applications based on demand.

**4.	Enterprise-grade Support** – Features like advanced load balancing, networking, and security make Kubernetes production-ready.

**High-Level Architecture of Kubernetes**

Kubernetes architecture consists of two main layers:

**1.	Control Plane** – Manages cluster-wide operations.

**2.	Data Plane (Worker Nodes)** – Runs the actual workloads.

Let’s explore each layer in detail.

**1. Data Plane (Worker Nodes)**

The **worker nodes** execute applications as **pods** (collections of containers). Each node contains:

**1.	Kubelet** – Ensures that all assigned pods are running and reports node health to the control plane.

**2.	Kube Proxy** – Handles network routing and load balancing within the cluster.

**3.	Container Runtime** – Executes containers (e.g., Docker, Containerd, CRI-O).

**How Pods Work in Kubernetes**

A **pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, equivalent to a **Docker container**, but with enhanced features like networking and storage.

**Comparison: Container in Docker vs. Pod in Kubernetes**

| Feature          | Docker Container | Kubernetes Pod |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Unit of Deployment | Single Container | One or more Containers |
| Networking      | Uses Docker bridge | Uses CNI-based networking |
| Scaling        | Manual | Automated with ReplicaSets |
| Self-healing   | No | Yes (via Kubelet) |

**Worker Node Components Explained**

**1. Kubelet**

•	A process running on each node.

•	Ensures that containers inside pods are running.

•	Reports node status to the control plane.

**2. Kube Proxy**

•	Manages IP addresses and network rules.

•	Provides load balancing across multiple pod replicas.

•	Uses **iptables** or **IPVS** for network communication.

**3. Container Runtime**

•	Executes containers within a pod.

•	Kubernetes supports multiple runtimes:

o	Docker

o	Containerd

o	CRI-O

**2. Control Plane (Master Components)**

The **control plane manages** the cluster and schedules workloads on worker nodes. It consists of:

**1.	API Server** – The entry point for all Kubernetes requests.

**2.	Scheduler** – Assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability.

**3.	Controller Manager** – Manages controllers like ReplicaSets. Also it check the desired state of the pod, in case of any failure, it make to restart the container

**4.	Etcd** – Stores the cluster state in a key-value database.

**5.	Cloud Controller Manager** – Integrates Kubernetes with cloud providers.

**Control Plane Components Explained**

**1. API Server (kube-apiserver)**

•	Exposes Kubernetes APIs.

•	Processes all CRUD operations on Kubernetes objects.

•	Acts as the front-end of the control plane.

**2. Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**

•	Assigns pods to worker nodes based on:

o	Resource availability

o	Pod affinity/anti-affinity

o	Taints and tolerations

**3. Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**

•	Manages controllers, including:

**o	ReplicaSet Controller** – Ensures the correct number of pod replicas.

**o	Node Controller** – Monitors node health.

**o	Endpoints Controller** – Updates services with pod IPs.

**4. etcd**

•	Stores the entire cluster state.

•	Uses a distributed key-value store.

•	Essential for disaster recovery and backups.

**5. Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)**

•	Allows Kubernetes to integrate with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

- **Manages:**

    ◦ Load balancers
  
    ◦ Storage provisioning
  
    ◦ Node management

**How Kubernetes Schedules and Runs Applications**

When a user deploys an application, the following steps occur:

**1.**	The request reaches the **API Server**.

**2.**	The **Scheduler** assigns the pod to a suitable node.

**3.**	The **Kubelet** on the node ensures the pod is running.

**4.	Kube Proxy** sets up networking for the pod.

**5.**	If the pod fails, the **Controller Manager** ensures a new pod is created.

**Example: Deploying a Pod in Kubernetes**

```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the pod using:

```sh
kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml
```

**Best Practices for Kubernetes Architecture**

**1.	Use Multi-Master Control Planes** – Prevents single points of failure.

**2.	Use RBAC for Security** – Restrict access to cluster resources.

**3.	Monitor Cluster Health** – Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

**4.	Implement Network Policies** – Secure pod-to-pod communication.

**5.	Automate Scaling** – Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).**

**Conclusion**

Understanding **Kubernetes architecture** is crucial for DevOps engineers managing containerized workloads.

**Key Takeaways**

**•	Worker nodes** run applications via **Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and Container Runtime.**

**•	Control plane** manages the cluster with **API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd, and Cloud Controller Manager.**

**•	Pods** are the smallest deployable units, replacing traditional Docker containers.

**•	Networking, scaling, and self-healing** are built into Kubernetes.

By mastering Kubernetes architecture, you can optimize deployments and prepare for DevOps interviews.
